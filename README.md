##  Hi, I'm Alvin Zhang

🔬 I'm a rising senior at the Middlesex School in Concord, MA, interested in bioinformatics, computer science, and computational biology.

### About Me
- Currently interning at the [Xihong Lin Lab](https://hsph.harvard.edu/research/lin-lab/), Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health - Working on FAVOR project, developed FAVORannotator Agent, manuscript to be submitted. 
- Former intern at [Heng Li Lab](https://hlilab.github.io/), Dana-Farber Cancer Institute — worked on benchmarking RNA-seq aligners using long-read sequencing as ground truth.
- Strong background in Python, Java, and growing frontend/full-stack development experience.
- Currently exploring: AI agents, genomics, and machine learning.

### 📌 Key Projects
- [`shortreadRNAalignercomparison`](https://github.com/alvintzhang/shortreadRNAalignercomparison): Comparative evaluation of STAR, HISAT2, and Minimap2 for short-read RNA-seq, with CIGAR string accuracy metrics using long-read subreads.
- `leetcode`: My growing problem-solving archive, reflecting my commitment to algorithmic thinking and efficient code design.
- 'FAVORannotator Agent'

### Tech Stack
- Python (pysam, pandas, matplotlib, numpy, etc)
- Java (OOP, concurrent programming)
- Bioinformatics: Minimap2, STAR, HISAT2, samtools
- Web: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Vercel, React
- Tools: Git, bash, VSCode, Conda
